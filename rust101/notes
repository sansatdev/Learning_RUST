1. 'fn' keyword is used to define a function in rust 
2. program starts executing from a main function named main
3. println! is used to get standard output and it's a macros ( these are buildin functions )
4. We can't use single quote for strings like python.
5. Variables are imuteable in rust we can rewrite a vaiable if it was defined as mutable using "mut" keyword eg: let mut a: &str = "Hello , world!";
6. Constants can be declared outside of the function so we don't use let for constant and they are immutable and they are global
7. while referring to numbers we can use underscrore as seperater like comma for better readability and we can use suffix as well 
8. In rust max value of tuple = 12; tuples use () . This can contain any data type 
9. Max values of array =  32 ; arrays uses [] . This can contain only specific data type as this is array.
